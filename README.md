This is an Indian Sign Language Recognition System created using CNN.
The model is trained on around 9.5K plus images created and processed by me.
The model does not require any pre-processing of the input image. In order to skip the image pre-processing step the model was trained on a dataset which contained only the hands making the signs.
I was able to achieve 91.% accuracy. The model is designed in such a manner that it could take in as much portion of image possible to identify simple patterns, then multiple layers are used which would help it to understand complex patterns easily.
