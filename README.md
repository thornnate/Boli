This is an Indian Sign Language Recognition System created using CNN.
The model is trained on around 9.5K plus images created and processed by me.
The model does not require any pre-processing of the input image. In order to skip the image pre-processing step the model was trained on a dataset which contained only the hands making the signs.
I have also uploaded the dataset.
I have written a research paper on the same which I have uploaded too for a better understanding of the model.
